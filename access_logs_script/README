This folder has one bash script and two MySQL query script files. 
The bash script scourges for all MySQL databases the names of which match with "mostfit_" except for mostfit_box
and runs the query in the query.sql file against each of those databases.
The other sql file does what the function name suggests(gets the list of all databases in that have are available to the user)
